For the past few years I've taken over the development of <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/iclip/" target="_blank">iClip 5</a>, a Clipboard / Pasteboard tool for OS X after the original author abandoned it to instead get insanely rich with selling iOS apps and organizing Bundle deals.<br /><br />iClip is now again in beta testing. The new version adds a search feature that also lets you create smart search sets in order to see ony specific clippings, e.g. only those from a particular applications.<br /><br />If you like to help testing iClip, even if you've never used it before, please sign up with <a href="http://macdeveloper.net/" target="_blank">MacDeveloper</a>, then subscribe to&nbsp;<a href="http://macdeveloper.net/projects/view/229" target="_blank">iClip</a>&nbsp;there. The MacDeveloper site helps us (i.e. me and the folks at Irradiated Software) manage bug reports and feature requests, and in return you as a tester can collect points in order to get the software for free if you don't own it yet.<br /><br />
