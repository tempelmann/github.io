This post has nothing particular of interest, I'm just venting because I need a break. Read on to understand why:<br /><br />I'm very detail oriented when I program. And when I see a critical bug, I need to fix it right away. I get so hooked on it that I often go into long sessions, and I'll be miserable if I have to stop in the middle of it.<br /><br />Now, here's an example of what often happens then:<br /><br />I am working on a paid project for a client. It has to do with recovering data from a complex file structure.<br /><br />The data structures are in binary format, so I need to be able to read the data inside.<br /><br />Since I have my own disk editor, <a href="http://apps.tempel.org/iBored/" target="_blank">iBored</a>, I start writing a template for this file format. Since iBored's template system is a work in progress, it naturally leads to me having to add new code to iBored to suit a particular new construct in the template syntax. So I add new code to iBored.<br /><br />The template system uses RbScript so that I can perform calculations to decypher complex data structures. RbScript is fairly limited by default, though. For instance, there is no sort function.<br /><br />Which means that I have to write a sort function in RbScript. I need a RbScript editor. <a href="http://www.xojo.com/" target="_blank">Real Studio's</a> own Script editor sucks enormously - it doesn't even have Undo. Fortunately, there is <a href="http://www.tempel.org/Arbed" target="_blank">Arbed</a>.&nbsp;It has a better RbScript editor.<br /><br />While writing my script in Arbed, I notice that its syntax parser doesn't indent Interfaces correctly. I like to fix that. I can, because Arbed is another tool of mine.<br /><br />The RbScript editor and syntax highlighter is coming from the open source class "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/custom-editfield/" target="_blank">CustomEditField</a>", written by Alex Restrepo. He has stopped working on it. Coincidentally, I took over.<br /><br />Thus I am working several hours on the&nbsp;CustomEditField open source project to fix its indentation code, which is fairly convoluted (partly my fault). Eventually I get this done.<br /><br />Next I need to merge the fixes of the&nbsp;CustomEditField project into the Arbed project file. Naturally, I use Arbed for this.<br /><br />Merging takes a while because I had recently added new features to&nbsp;CustomEditField directly in Arbed, without merging those improvements back into the open source version. Meaning that I have to merge some code from CEF to Arbed, and other code in the other direction. I have to do this carefully. But eventually, I get all the changes merged into both projects.<br /><br />When I try to save the updated projects, Arbed gives me an error message:&nbsp;<i>wrong id in block header</i>.<br /><br />Great. So I have to find this bug. Takes me another 2 hours. It was very very well hidden.<br /><br />That's where I am as of writing this blog post.<br /><br />Now, I can go back to merge the changes between the projects once again. Then I can hopefully continue writing the Sort function in RbScript, after which I can finish the iBored template to view the data so that I can write the code I'm getting paid for.<br /><br />Programming is fun. But so exhausting when you care too much.
