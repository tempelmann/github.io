<span style="font-family: inherit;">I recently found out that some printer drives using the CUPS printing system stopped working on OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) that worked fine with the previous OSX Mavericks (10.9).</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">After some googling around I found various suggestions, but none seemed to help. In the end, it turned out that I had to follow THREE different suggestions to make it work. To save you the same odysee, here's my recipe for making printer drivers work again that stopped working on Yosemite:</span><br /><div></div><ol><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Remove any troublesome printers from the "Printers &amp; Scanners" System Preferences.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Re-Install the printer driver.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Fix the permissions of the installed cups drivers by starting the "Disk Utility" program, selecting the startup disk and clicking on "Repair Disk Permissions".</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Turn off the tighter Sandboxing checks in Yosemite with these two Terminal commands:</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">sudo sh -c 'echo "Sandboxing Relaxed" &gt;&gt; /etc/cups/cups-files.conf'</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">sudo launchctl stop org.cups.cupsd</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Connect the printer and re-add the printer in the "Printers &amp; Scanners" settings.</span></li></ol><span style="font-family: inherit;">Hope this helps. If it does, please spread the word. If it doesn't, let me know please.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">And, if you found this useful, also check out some other work of mine, such as:</span></div><div><br /><ul><li><a href="http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile" style="font-family: inherit;" target="_blank">Find Any File</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> - The program that finds the files that Spotlight doesn't.</span></li><li><a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/iclip/" style="font-family: inherit;" target="_blank">iClip</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> - Improves the workflow with text snippets and the clipboard in general.</span></li></ul></div><div><br /></div>
