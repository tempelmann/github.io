I am close to releasing the next version of my tool "Arbed" for&nbsp;Xojo and Real Studio project files.<br /><br />As explained in my <a href="http://blog.tempel.org/2013/09/XojoFileFormats.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I have added code that performs a self-check to make sure it doesn't miss anything when reading and writing a Xojo project in textual (VCP) format.<br /><br />If you haven't yet, please download the latest beta from&nbsp;<a href="http://files.tempel.org/Arbed/beta/1.7.0/b13/">http://files.tempel.org/Arbed/beta/1.7.0/b13/</a>&nbsp;and launch it, then open your .rbvcp and .xojo_project projects with it. (<i>Either use the "Open" command from the File menu, or drag and drop your projects onto its main "Arbed Drop Pad" window, into the "Project Editor" group box.</i>)<br /><br />If you get an error or verification failure message, please let me know and I'll fix the issue within a day or two.
