Today I'm just helping promote someone else's work.<br /><br />With this blog being directed mainly to other (programming) geeks, I think you might even be the right audience:<br /><br />Did you enjoy playing <b>Monkey Island</b>, <b>Leisure Suit Larry</b> and other funny point-and-click adventures? (Though, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_in_the_Land_of_the_Lounge_Lizards" target="_blank">first Larrys</a> I played were running still on DOS, without mouse support.)<br /><br />And do you enjoy british humour?<br /><br />And, possibly, are you on <b>Steam</b>?<br /><br />Then have a look at this hilarious&nbsp;<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=281925854" target="_blank">Nelly Cootalot</a> promo!<br /><br />The game is designed by a british film maker, and it's not his first go at an adventure, however this one is made much more professionally. Support his quest for getting the game onto Steam - <i>don't be a coward</i>!<br /><br />I support this because long time friends of mine are involved in the development and distribution, and at some time I was almost becoming part of the dev team as well. I'd have loved to but I'm already busy with so many other projects I couldn't take on another one.<br /><br />The game already got its basic funding <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/315061806/nelly-cootalot-the-fowl-fleet-retro-pirate-adventu?ref=card" target="_blank">through Kickstarter</a> earlier this year, and now this is a step up to get onto Steam, giving it a much wider reach.<br /><br />Also, <b>it'll run on Macs</b>, which is always good.
