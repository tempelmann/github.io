This is a small assortment of tips and tricks to make you understand the Xojo language better.<br /><br /><h3>The differences between identifiers, keywords and&nbsp;reserved words</h3><div><br />Even though the IDE paints them all the same color, they're not the same in the way you can use them in code code:</div><div><ul><li><i>Identifiers</i> are words you can use to name your methods, properties, variables etc.</li><li><i>Reserved Words</i>&nbsp;(or <i>reserved names</i>) are all those that you can never use as identifiers. This includes: <i><b>if</b></i>, <b><i>then</i></b>, <i><b>to</b></i>, <i><b>function</b></i>, <i><b>end</b></i>, <i><b>attribute</b></i></li><li><i>Keywords</i> are a mix of the above. They are all those words that are pre-defined by the compiler. This not only includes the <i>Reserved Words</i> but also standard types such as <i><b>String</b></i>, <i><b>Integer</b></i>, <i><b>Boolean</b></i> and <i><b>Color</b></i>. But it does not include <i>Date</i>, for instance - that's a name from the framework, i.e. it's practically code written in Xojo that you do not see but that the compiler secretly adds to your source code when building your program. You can tell the difference if you use XojoScript (RbScript), which is a bare bones access to the compiler without most of the framework: While you can use Color there, the Date class is not available. (Note, however, that even XojoScript gives you a small framework to work with that includes some strings operations and the Print function, for instance).</li></ul><div>Now, here's the interesting part:<br /><br /></div></div><div>Whereas you cannot declare a variable with the name attribute, you can declare one with the name boolean!</div><div><br />Here is an example that actually works:</div><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;dim boolean as integer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;boolean = 2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;MsgBox "The value of the variable 'boolean' is "+Str(boolean)<br /></pre>While the above is quite some nonsense, it can be used in other ways, too, for instance in an enumeration. You can declare an Enum named <i>Types</i> and add the values <i>String</i>, <i>Integer</i>, <i>Boolean</i> to it. Then you can write:<br /><div><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;dim t as Types<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;t = Types.Integer</pre>BTW, for that very reason that reserved words (<i>if</i>, <i>then</i> etc.) are not the same as predefined types (<i>String</i>, <i>Integer</i> etc.), I tend to write the former always in lower case while I write types (both predefined and self-declared ones) always in upper case. So, while some may think my mixed case code writing is inconsistent, it actually follows rules based on the understanding of the language.<br /><br /><h3>Boolean logic</h3><div><br />I often see beginners not making best use of Boolean types.</div><br />For instance:<br /><pre>&nbsp; if found = True then<br /></pre>could also be written as:<br /><pre>&nbsp; if (not (found&nbsp;&lt;&gt; true)) &lt;&gt; false then<br /></pre>The second example is clearly unreadable and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;quite counterproductive. The first one is, to some lesser extent, similar in that nature.<br /><br /><div>The recommended variant would be:</div><pre>&nbsp; if&nbsp;found&nbsp;then<br /></pre>Read it aloud. Doesn't that sound better than the first example?<br /><br />In the same way,<br /><pre>&nbsp; if found = False then<br /></pre>should be written as:<br /><pre>&nbsp; if not found then<br /></pre><div>Think about this the next time when you choose a name for a Boolean property or variable. Name it so that it reads well in a "if ... then" sentence, avoiding "= false" and "= true" constructs. It clutters your code and makes it often less readable.</div><br /><div>Similarly, you may want to avoid constructs like these:</div><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;if me.Value = true then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; button1.Enabled = true<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; button1.Enabled = false<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br /></pre>Why not simply:<br /><pre>&nbsp; // enable&nbsp;button1&nbsp;only if this checkbox is checked<br />&nbsp; button1.Enabled = me.Value</pre>Though, some may argue that "me.Value" is not self-explanatory, thus "me.Value = true" is adding some context. Here's an alternative that's even more self-explanatory:<br /><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;dim checked as Boolean = me.Value<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;if checked then</pre><div>and, analogously:<br /><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;dim checkboxChecked as Boolean = me.Value<br />&nbsp; button1.Enabled = checkboxChecked</pre><div><br /></div></div></div>
