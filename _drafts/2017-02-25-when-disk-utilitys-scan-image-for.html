I've recently wanted to try to install OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) on an older MacBook Pro Core 2 Dup ("macbookpro2,2"), using MacPostFactor 2.0.1. Since that's not unlikely to fail, leaving me with an unsusable system, I quickly made a backup of the entire disk using Disk Utility, so that I would be able to restore the entire Mac's disk if something went wrong.<br /><br />Of course, the installation did not work (it would be "Creating MacPostFactor Recovery (with packages)", only to then reboot, without end).<br /><br />When I then tried to restore the disk from my backup, Disk Utility would require that I perform the&nbsp;"Scan Image for Restore…" command first.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when that failed as well, with the following error message:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-00lTvyhjxQU/WLDX59gd57I/AAAAAAAACo0/9rL1J7gKu2kqfhK100mv8bQ6hPsPjgkjACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-25%2Bat%2B02.01.54.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="210" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-00lTvyhjxQU/WLDX59gd57I/AAAAAAAACo0/9rL1J7gKu2kqfhK100mv8bQ6hPsPjgkjACLcB/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-25%2Bat%2B02.01.54.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Unable to scan "backup.dmg" (Internal error)</i></div><br />I could not even mount the disk image, as that would result in this error:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eUKr8d3J_BY/WLDX8zaGipI/AAAAAAAACo4/A8-7JNQs7roJp4ZgqK6ZwuvZnWTTnQO5gCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-25%2Bat%2B01.06.17.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="210" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eUKr8d3J_BY/WLDX8zaGipI/AAAAAAAACo4/A8-7JNQs7roJp4ZgqK6ZwuvZnWTTnQO5gCLcB/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-02-25%2Bat%2B01.06.17.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Unable to attach "backup.dmg" (no mountable file systems)</i></div><br />After some poking around I found that the disk image is intact, however. Why it would neither checksum nor mount is a mystery to me. Maybe it was the fact that I used the <i>compressed</i> option when creating it, though that should still not be a problem.<br /><br />How would I get the compressed disk image back onto my Mac's disk?<br /><br />With a non-compressed "plain" disk image, one could simply use the "dd" Terminal command to copy the dmg file back to the disk. But with most dmg files, this won't work. The trick is to let Disk Utility open the disk image without mounting it (mounting did fail, as I wrote above). After that, the "dd" command can be used to write the data back. Much easier, and less error prone, can this be done with my tool <a href="http://apps.tempel.org/iBored/" target="_blank">iBored</a>, though. Here's how:<br /><br /><i>(Note, while this shows screenshots of the older Disk Utility app that was provided with pre-10.11 systems, it will work with the new Disk Utility app just as well.)</i><br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Drag&nbsp;</li></ol>
