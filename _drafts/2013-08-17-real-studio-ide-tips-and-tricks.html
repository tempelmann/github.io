<br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(This is a repost of an article of mine on Real Software's, now Xojo Inc.,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realsoftwareblog.com/" target="_blank">former blog</a>. Some of this only applies to the pre-Xojo IDE, Real Studio, some of it may work even better in Xojo now.)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here are a few tricks for using the Real Studio IDE more efficiently:</span><br /><br /><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finding all declarations of a method</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Let's assume you have a several methods named "DoSomething" and they are called all over your code, hundreds of times.&nbsp;To find the methods' code you could enter it into the Finder box or right-click on the name where it's called and use the Find command from the contextual menu.&nbsp;But that will reveal not only the method declarations but also all the calls to it.&nbsp;How do you find just the declarations then?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Note that even method declarations in the IDE are internally known with their "proper" RbScript-like code wrapper, e.g.:</span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; Sub DoSomething (action as Integer)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And you can search these entire lines.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So, to find just the methods, you search for "Sub DoSomething", or even shorter "&nbsp;DoSomething" (note the blank at the beginning), assuming DoSomething is a class member method which is usally referenced with a object name and a&nbsp;".".</span><br /><br /><div style="margin: 0px;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finding the one declaration of a method</span></b></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You can quickly jump to a method or property declaration if you hold down the Command (Windows: Control) key and then double click on its name in the code.</span><br /><br /><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Preserving previous Find results when performing another search</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Normally, when you perform a Find operation, the results will always be shown in the same Tab, overwriting the previous results.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To prevent that, simply turn the results Tab into its own window, by either right-clicking on the Tab and choosing "Open In New Window", or by dragging the Tab out of the main window. That will open a new window showing just the results. These results won't get replaced when you perform the next search operation.</span><br /><br /><b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Remembering breakpoints</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Do you use breakpoints often, would you like to keep them when you save and re-open your project?&nbsp;Note that only the XML and RBP project file formats preserve breakpoints, while the textual VCP format doesn't.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you don't want to switch to the other formats but like your code to stop in certain places, place the statement "break" into the code instead of using a breakpoint. The break statement has the same effect (though you can't simply turn it off during a debugging run like you can with a breakpoint).</span><br /><div><br /></div>
