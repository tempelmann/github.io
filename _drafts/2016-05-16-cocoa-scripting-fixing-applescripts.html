I have spent the past 6 weeks and over 200 hours (conveniently measured with the excellent <a href="https://timingapp.com/" target="_blank">Timing</a> app) on writing a scripting framework for OS X apps made with Xojo, based on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications" target="_blank">Cocoa Scripting</a> framework.<br /><br />During this time, I ran into a lot of things that were either not documented, hard to understand or even caused by bugs not fixed by Apple for over 10 years now.<br /><br />Here's a summary of things I like to share with other developers, not limited to Xojo.<br /><br /><br />A few people gave me valuable input in figuring this all out. My special thanks go to Mark Aldritt (author of the awesome Script Debugger), Ron Reuter (now-retired Mac developer) and Stefan Klieme. Furthermore, Jan Magens helped me debugging and improving scripting support for iClip.<br /><br /><br />
