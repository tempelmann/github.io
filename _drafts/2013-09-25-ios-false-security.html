There's something that bothers me for quite a while now about iOS and its supposedly <i>"secure"</i> system versus the <i>insecure</i> jailbreaking.<br /><br />Sadly, mainstream has accepted this paradigm so widely that I can't find <i>any</i>&nbsp;critical voices against this belief.<br /><br />Well, here's one example where Apple (and everyone who just repeats their claims) has it wrong:<br /><br />Apple can not protect you from apps that <i style="font-weight: bold;">call home</i> against your will. You won't even ever know!<br /><br />For example, that new Facebook or Twitter program, that better email program, all those program that ask you for your login, they all <i>could</i>&nbsp;take the login and password and secretly send them to someone who can then take advantage of this, e.g. by sending spam from your account or wreak other havoc.<br /><br />The worst example are programs that let you remote control your computer from your iPhone or iPad. The login you provide to the program can give others full access to your computer as well.<br /><br />And you have no way to control or monitor this. All you can is&nbsp;<i>trust</i>&nbsp;the program not to send your secret data away.<br /><br />Of course, as soon as such an abuse is discovered by someone, word would get to Apple, and Apple would hopefully act quick and remove the app from the Store and ban the developer from ever submitting apps again in the App Store. But that's all Apple can do. If you have a grand scheme and enough cousins to open new developer accounts, this won't be much of a deterrent for your "business".<br /><br />Just recently, <a href="http://ryanhileman.info/posts/webgl" target="_blank">someone described a real-life example</a>: A popular program to enhance web browsing for jailbroken iPhones secretly loads a webpage every few minutes, apparently to trigger access to an affiliate advertising on the page, thereby earning a few cents(?) for every access.<br /><br />Even though this app was available only on jailbroken devices, this doesn't make it safe for non-jailbroken ones. Similar code could as well be hidden in a sandboxed app from the iOS App Store. (There are plenty of ways to hide such access from Apple's review process.)<br /><br />I'd be happy to submit such an app as a proof-of-concept to the App Store, but I have no cousins, and I like to keep my other apps in the Store for now.<br /><br />But the problem remains: Apple's reviewers are not able to detect such malign programs, and even us users have a hard time to detect such abuse. There is no firewall that we could use on the device to tell which servers it contacts, so we can't even know what it does when it talks to the world wide internet.<br /><br />One solution might be to load such an app onto a jailbroken(!) device where we might be able to install firewall software to monitor the apps. The irony!<br /><br />
